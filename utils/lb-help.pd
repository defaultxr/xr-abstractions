#X text 184 134 [lb] is like [loadbang] \, but you can provide a number as an argument and it will output that number instead of a bang.;
#X text 185 182 A second argument can be provided to specify a value if the first argument is zero. This is useful as a "fallback" value. For example \, if you use \$1 as the first argument but it's not provided in the parent patch \, then [lb]'s second argument will be output instead. This is because arguments that aren't provided default to 0 . Of course \, you need to be careful about this since if the argument IS provided \, and it's provided as a 0 \, then the second argument of [lb] will be output instead of 0 as the user intended. If that's a concern \, you might want to manually parse the list of arguments with an object like [pdcontrol] instead \; specifically \, with its "args" message.;
