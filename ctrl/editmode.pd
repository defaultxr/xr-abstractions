#X text 612 55 I originally thought that toggling edit mode twice would be an easy way to determine whether it's active in a certain patch... But I realized that has strange side effects \, so I disabled it.;
#X text 68 125 Edit mode is active by default on new patches and inactive by default on loaded patches. We assume that edit mode is active at first since that's the more common case. It's also less likely to cause unwanted things to happen since usually you'll want to disable functions when edit mode is on.;
#X text 67 19 editmode - output 1 when edit mode is on \, output 0 when it's off.;
#X text 66 62 Note that this abstraction is not 100% reliable \, because (as far as I'm currently aware) it's not possible to detect with complete certainty whether edit mode is on in a Pd patch.;
